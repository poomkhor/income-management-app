## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving

-   I first created wireframe for the project to get some visualization
-   then I structure the data by creating ERD diagram to help with data relationship
-   then I create a Trello board to help keep track of the functions and features to accomplish. [Click here](https://trello.com/invite/b/w2eOcCTO/ATTIf77c9fbcf0f8fa395fa8f5ea6f6d0c2565026329/user-stories) to see my Trello board
